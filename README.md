A simulated Claude Code project you can click through. Every file and folder in the sidebar is a real Claude Code concept — the same `.claude/` directory, config files, and scaffolding you'd find in an actual repo. Click any file to learn what it does, how to set it up, and see annotated examples you can copy into your own projects.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

| Folder / File | Feature |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project memory that persists across sessions |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Permissions, tool access, and guardrails |
| `.claude/rules/` | Contextual conventions scoped to specific file types |
| `.claude/commands/` | Custom slash commands for saved workflows |
| `.claude/skills/` | Knowledge folders Claude loads autonomously |
| `.claude/agents/` | Subagents for specialised, delegated tasks |
| `.claude/hooks/` | Shell scripts that run on Claude lifecycle events |
| `.claude/plugins/` | Extend Claude with custom tools and resources |
| `.mcp.json` | MCP server config for external tool integrations |
| `src/` | Example source code sitting alongside real config |
| **built-in/** | Features that ship with Claude Code (no setup required) |
| `built-in/bundled-skills/` | `/simplify`, `/batch`, `/debug`, `/loop`, `/claude-api` |

The explorer is split into two sections. Everything under `.claude/` is project config you create and commit. Everything under `built-in/` covers features that ship with Claude Code out of the box, no setup required. A visual separator divides the two.

Every piece of content is written as if it were a real config file in a real repo. You're not reading *about* the config, you're reading *the config itself*, annotated so you understand every line. When you're done exploring, you can copy the scaffolding straight into your own projects.

## 🚀 Try It

The fastest way to get started is the live site:

**👉 [exploreclaudecode.com](https://exploreclaudecode.com)**

No install, no signup, no build step. Just open it and start clicking.

If you want to run it locally, clone the repo and point any static server at the `site/` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LukeRenton/explore-claude-code.git
cd explore-claude-code

npx serve site
# or
python -m http.server -d site 8080
# or just open site/index.html directly in your browser
```
## 🏗️ Project Structure

The entire site is static HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Zero build steps, zero frameworks, zero bundlers.

```

All educational content is stored in `site/data/manifest.json` and the source files in `site/content/`. The manifest is the single source of truth for the tree structure, badges, feature groupings, and content references. To add or change content, that's where you go.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are some areas where help would be great:

- **Content** for new Claude Code features as they ship
- **Accessibility** improvements (keyboard nav, screen readers, ARIA)
- **Mobile** experience refinements
- **Translations** into other languages

If you'd like to add or update educational content, the two places to look are:
1. `site/data/manifest.json` for tree structure and metadata
2. `site/content/` for the actual markdown and config files

Feel free to open an issue if you have ideas or spot something that could be better.
